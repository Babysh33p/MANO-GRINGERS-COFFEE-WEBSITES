						   beans.She made it her daily obligatory to make coffee 
						   for her loved ones.She did that and kept going with 
						   getting up early in the morning to make coffee for 
						   her family.While she did so she expected to please 
						   only her father who was extremely stubborn to the 
						   core about how coffee was made.He taught her that 
						   coffee should be made from the hurt for a better
						   taste or else it will taste like burnt ash in warm
						   water.She took the advice and made this her drive 
						   until 2011,when she decided to take her coffee 
						   desires to the next level.She sold coffee in a 
						   local store that she worked in.The manager allowed
						   her to worked in the kitchen and not behind the 
						   cashier although she had the qualifications to 
						   run and work behind a computer.She rejected it 
						   all for a job in the kitchen.She worked there 
						   for 2 years with makeing an income worth R 4000.00 .
						   With her dedication and saving up of her income
						   which was close to R 6000.00.She quit but at the
						   end came across a sign selling a mini truck being
						   sold for R 35,000.00.She took it as an oportunity 
						   to buy it.She renovated the truck and sold in it 
						   for 3 years.With a dream of selling in the truck 
						   for a better future progress.three years later 
						   she met a sign very old and messy written"STORE 
						   FOR SELL R 60,000.00.This considered this as a 
						   gate of a new story.She continued working at her 
						   truck for the longest period to reach the goal.She
						   worked extremely hard to pay off the removations and 
						   the other expenses.IN THE END SHE MADE IT ALL HAPPEN
						   TO BRING "MANO GRINDERS COFFEE TO LIFE.</P></font>

		<p><FONT COLOR="BLACK">There was never an "I" in "WE" in our grinders inspireration.
								We conducted a survy in what people would like in their COFFEE
								from our truck store.While we made this survy clear we decided 
								to add more to our cofee menu and add in new flavours and toppings.
								Our customers kept our inspiration going and we took their advices 
								on what we could adjust better.</P></font>
			<H2><FONT COLOR="black">HOW WE CHOSE OUR PASTRIES...</H2></font>
			<P><font color="black">There is no "I" in "TEAM".We came 
									to a conclusion that we cannot just serve
									plain coffee.We then decided that we will 
									have to serve what our customers may need 
									a little morning wake up call.We went back 
									to our homes and took little hints of what
									our fammilies baked every christmas.We then
									remebered how our family memebers shared 
									deliciuos pastries.Here we are and brought 
									it all to life.That is why today you have 
									our deliciuos pastries in your stomaches.</p></FONT>
